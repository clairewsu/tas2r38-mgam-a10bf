how the tas2r38 could affect the ad risk if its not expressed it the brain

we did models on the genes that are within 1 Mb of the gene for cis eqtl within dlpfc and hcn and pcc and there were a few genes significant in multiple regions such as wee2as1 and tas2r5 and mgam

we also did a box plot for mgam comparing how the gene affects its expression and braak (which the script is shown in the mayo and msbb repo)

and then we went and did cit to see how the association affects the expression of even more genes and put into metascape where some of them were seen to be associated with cognition and ad
and it was done for 4 groups 1 with less data and 1 with all the combined data and 1 with only ad and 1 with only no ad
