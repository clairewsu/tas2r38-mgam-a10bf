we only included the ppl with diabetes and categorize the drugs theyre taking based on a10 code and match the mgam inhibitor taker to non taker group
then we did survival analysis which compares the demented rate of the groups
and it was all done for ratio=1 and 2
also in nacc we also did the same thing in adni with the cdr but with the matched groups
