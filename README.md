next up on ur quest we looked at how the tas2r38 could possibly affect the ad risk if its not expressed it the brain???
the point was eqtl so we did a whole bunch of models on like every gene in chr7 for cis eqtl but then actually its only within a certain amt of mb so we did that too
and it was done within dlpfc and hcn and pcc and there were a few genes significant in multiple regions such as wee2as1 and tas2r5 and mgam!!!
so then mgam is super shiny special and we also did a box plot comparing how it affects mgam vs also braak and wow there was such a clear interaction bc like in previous studies ppl said diabetes is associated with ad fr
and then we went and did cit to see how the association affects the expression of even more genes and chucked them into metascape where it was found some cognition and ad ones
and it was done for 4 groups 1 with less data and 1 with all the combined data and 1 with only ad and 1 with only no ad
