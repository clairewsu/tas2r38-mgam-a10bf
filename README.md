finally its the finally boss where did u know there r some drugs to inhibit mgam so what if u kill the diabetes and the ad at the same time
then we got a bunch of data with ppl that r old and took drugs and we only included the ppl with diabetes so u can match the mgam inhibitor to non inhibitor group
but first u hv to convert what drugs theyre taking into codes and then make it a binary status for whether theyre taking it or not so that was a whole thing that was happened
then after that and the matching u can surivival them which compares the demented rate of the groups which btw we removed all the ppl that started with dementia
and it was all done for ratio=1 and 2
also in nacc we also did the same thing in adni with the cdr but with the matched groups
